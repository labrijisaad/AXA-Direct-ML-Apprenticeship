**Welcome** to the repository that captures my year as a **Machine Learning Engineer Apprentice** at **AXA - Direct Assurance**.

## Overview 🌟

- **Company**: AXA - Direct Assurance
- **Duration**: October 2023 - October 2024 (1 year)
- **Location**: Paris, France
- **Role**: Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist

## Objective 🚀

My primary goal is to enhance legacy ML systems by implementing MLOps best practices. This includes the development of automated ML pipelines that incorporate training, feature selection, data drift detection, and model deployment, all based on existing production ML codes.

## Core Projects and Responsibilities 🏆

Here's a snapshot of what I've been working on:

1. **`Automated Kedro Pipelines on Databricks`**: Focusing on the development and deployment of automated Kedro pipelines on Databricks, which are essential for monitoring data drift in production machine learning models.

2. **`Collaboration and Integration`**: Collaborating with internal ML/Data teams and external service providers to deploy Kedro versions of legacy machine learning models on Databricks.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️

During the Apprenticeship, I utilized a variety of tools and technologies, with the main ones being:

- **Azure Databricks**: For creating scalable and efficient data and ML workflows.
- **MLflow**: Managing the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
- **Kedro**: Building data pipelines that are modular, robust, scalable, and maintainable.
- **Azure DevOps**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Scikit-Learn / Jupyter Notebook / Python**: Employing these tools for building, testing, and prototyping machine learning models.
